# Integrating experimental exploration and data-driven modeling for granular hydrogel development

### Project abstract

Granular hydrogels have emerged as promising candidate materials for a range of future biotechnologies, but their structures and behaviors remain challenging to predict or design. Here, we combine experimentation and computation to develop an alginate-based granular hydrogel system in a bottom-up, stepwise fashion. Experimentally, we explored the initial synthesis of microgel building blocks, the intermediate processing of microgels into granular hydrogels, the characterization of critical rheological properties, and the ultimate assessment of injectability in diverse functional contexts. Computationally, we developed a flexible but rigorous machine learning pipeline that was applied after each phase of experimentation to automatically map the multidimensional input-output patterns into condensed data-driven models. These models were leveraged to assess the predictability of each heterogeneous experimental process and extract high-level design insights to support our progression into subsequent phases of material development and characterization. This combined approach made it feasible to derive material-specific predictive frameworks at each step in the material development workflow, which could potentially support the design of customized granular hydrogels with user-defined structures, properties, and performance profiles for future biotechnologies. Overall, the flexible integration of data-driven modeling into experimental workflows should be broadly applicable for applied materials scientists aiming to advance their understanding and control of complex emerging material systems.

*(A) The traditional materials science paradigm leverages empirical exploration to define reliable design processes for a materialâ€™s structure, properties, and performance profile. (B) The data-driven modeling paradigm leverages supervised machine learning to build predictive frameworks directly from the data itself. (C-F) Our integrated approach uses both empirical materials science and data-driven modeling to map complex input-output relationships for granular hydrogels at each stage of material development, covering the synthesis of microgel building blocks (C), processing of microgels into final granular hydrogels (D), characterization of emergent rheological behaviors (E), and assessment of qualitative and quantitative injectability (F).*
